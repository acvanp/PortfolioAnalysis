# PortfolioAnalysis
This is Python code for algorithms and operations research, specifically for the napsack problem in a portfolio or "value chain" of networked napsacks and netsted napsacks. It is for analysis of a portfolio model of value chains and similarly networked chains of transmitted values where items in a "napsack" are evaluated and prioritized, then the napsacks are bundled into napsacks of napsacks which are then bundled into yet more complex and larger assemblages. This may be useful in organizations where items are combined into something that is greater than the sum of its parts and then many items like that are combined into something more comblex, itself is greater than the sum of its parts. Examples include:
*  menus in a restaurant chain, 
* regional observations and forecasts in a national weather agency, 
* construction materials that go through a supply chain and into public works, 
* financial assets bundled into more complex financial constructs,
* clusters of research projects and collaborations in a state university system.

This modeling technique calculates how value is transmitted from the simplest raw materials up the levels of complexity in the value chain.
