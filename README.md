# PortfolioAnalysis
This is Python code for analysis of a portfolio model of value chains and similarly networked chains of transmitted values.

Imagine a value chain where raw ingredients go into simple products, and then those products are integrated into more complex products, which then get integrated into even more complex prducts, and so on. This could be a porfolio of ingredients that go into a restaurant menu, or construction materials that go into fabricating machines or building, or financial products that roll up into a nested value chain. This modeling technique calculates how value is transmitted from the simplest raw materials up the levels of complexity in the value chain.
